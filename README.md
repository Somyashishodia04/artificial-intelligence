During my artificial intelligence internship at Bharat Intern, I obtained knowledge and abilities in the following areas:

1. Fundamentals of Machine Learning:i have learnt the fundamentals of machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, and clustering, as well as the underlying mathematical ideas.

2. **In-Depth Learning:** Neural networks and their different architectures are used in deep learning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence data, and transformers for tasks like natural language processing may have been introduced to you.

3. NLP (Natural Language Processing):i have learned about tokenization, text preprocessing, language models, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text creation if you worked on NLP jobs.

4. **Computer Vision:** this internship required you to use computer vision,ihave learned about picture preprocessing, object detection, image segmentation, and visual data manipulation techniques.

5. **Data Preprocessing:** Understanding the significance of data quality, data cleansing, feature engineering, and missing value management is critical for developing effective AI models.

6.**Model Training and Assessment:**i  have learned how to train machine learning models, choose appropriate algorithms, and assess their performance using a variety of metrics.

7. **Visualization of Data:** Data visualization is frequently used to communicate results effectively. You may have learnt how to build interesting visualizations using tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

8.**Deployment: ** Deploying AI models into real-world applications sometimes necessitates familiarity with frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn, as well as cloud services for model hosting.
